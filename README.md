## What is this website about?
This is an NFT subscriptions marketplace, facilitating creators in minting and listing NFT memberships that unlock various benefits for buyers.

## Features
An NFT subscriptions marketplace is a platform designed to enable creators to mint and list NFT (Non-Fungible Token) memberships. These memberships grant buyers access to exclusive benefits, content, or experiences offered by the creators. Here's an elaboration on how such a marketplace might work:

- Creator Onboarding: The platform would allow creators to sign up and create accounts. They would then be able to mint NFT memberships tied to their content or services.

- Minting NFT Memberships: Buyers can mint NFTs that represent memberships of their favourite creator. Each NFT would be unique and securely stored on a blockchain, ensuring ownership and authenticity.

- Memberships: Once minted, buyers can take advantage of the benefits associated with each membership tier.

- Buyer Participation: Users interested in accessing the exclusive benefits offered by creators can browse the marketplace and purchase NFT memberships using cryptocurrency.
